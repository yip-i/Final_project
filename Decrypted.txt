MIDNIGHT, YOU COME AND PICK ME UP, NO HEADLIGHTS 
LONG DRIVE, COULD END IN BURNING FLAMES OR PARADISE 
FADE INTO VIEW, OH, 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I HAVE EVEN HEARD FROM YOU 
(HEARD FROM YOU) 
AND I SHOULD JUST TELL YOU TO LEAVE 'CAUSE I 
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT LEADS BUT I 
WATCH IT GO ROUND AND ROUND EACH TIME 
YOU GOT THAT JAMES DEAN DAYDREAM LOOK IN YOUR EYE 
AND I GOT THAT RED LIP, CLASSIC THING THAT YOU LIKE 
AND WHEN WE GO CRASHING DOWN, WE COME BACK EVERY TIME 
'CAUSE WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE, WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE 
YOU'VE GOT THAT LONG HAIR SLICK BACK, WHITE T-SHIRT 
AND I GOT THAT GOOD GIRL FAITH AND A TIGHT LITTLE SKIRT 
AND WHEN WE GO CRASHING DOWN, WE COME BACK EVERY TIME 
'CAUSE WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE, WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE 
SO IT GOES, HE CAN'T KEEP HIS WILD EYES ON THE ROAD 
TAKES ME HOME, LIGHTS ARE OFF HE'S TAKING OFF HIS COAT (HM YEAH) 
I SAY "I'VE HEARD THAT YOU'VE BEEN OUT AND ABOUT WITH SOME OTHER GIRL, SOME OTHER GIRL" 
HE SAYS "WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS TRUE BUT I 
CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU" AND I 
I SAID "I'VE BEEN THERE TOO A FEW TIMES" 
'CAUSE YOU GOT THAT JAMES DEAN DAYDREAM LOOK IN YOUR EYE 
AND I GOT THAT RED LIP, CLASSIC THING THAT YOU LIKE 
AND WHEN WE GO CRASHING DOWN, WE COME BACK EVERY TIME 
'CAUSE WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE, WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE 
YOU'VE GOT THAT LONG HAIR SLICK BACK, WHITE T-SHIRT 
AND I GOT THAT GOOD GIRL FAITH AND A TIGHT LITTLE SKIRT (A TIGHT LITTLE SKIRT) 
AND WHEN WE GO CRASHING DOWN, WE COME BACK EVERY TIME 
'CAUSE WE NEVER GO (WE NEVER GO) OUT OF STYLE, WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE 
TAKE ME HOME 
JUST TAKE ME HOME 
YEAH JUST TAKE ME HOME, OH 
YOU GOT THAT JAMES DEAN DAYDREAM LOOK IN YOUR EYE 
AND I GOT THAT RED LIP, CLASSIC THING THAT YOU LIKE 
AND WHEN WE GO CRASHING DOWN, WE COME BACK EVERY TIME 
'CAUSE WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE, WE NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE
